# Mathematical Derivative Calculator and Visualizer

A Python-based tool for calculating and visualizing mathematical derivatives. This project provides an intuitive interface for understanding derivatives through both numerical calculations and graphical representations.

## Features

- Symbolic derivative calculation
- Step-by-step derivative solving
- Interactive function visualization
- Support for common mathematical functions
- Detailed computation logs
- Export capabilities for graphs and calculations

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/derivative-calculator.git
cd derivative-calculator
pip install -r requirements.txt
from derivative_calculator import DerivativeCalculator

# Initialize calculator
calc = DerivativeCalculator()

# Calculate derivative
result = calc.calculate("x^2 + 2x + 1")
print(result.derivative)  # Output: 2x + 2

# Visualize functions
calc.visualize(-10, 10)  # Plots original and derivative

# Contributing to Mathematical Derivative Calculator

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from \`main\`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker]
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
